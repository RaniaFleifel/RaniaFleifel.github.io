This project is an exercise where I 
1) Scrape https://www.classcentral.com/ pages, 1-level deep using httrack
2) Use google translate api in python to translate website content to Hindi 
3) rebuild the structure of the pages such that the translated content are hard-coded into the translated website 
4) upload the translated-website into github (my choice of webserver)
5) make sure all javascript/css/etc is loading correctly 
6) make sure all buttons are clickable
